Web3 is a buzzword, you might heard it and your mind may also associate it with blockchain, cryptocurrencies and metaverse. Simply put, it is a decentralized Web meaning anyone can access or provide any data without worrying about any authority to suspect the chain of the data where it came from. Privacy, freedom are some of its buzz ideology to work on. Firstly discussing the Web3, lets take a look on the previous web concepts and ideologies.


## Web 1.0

Back in the days, everyone can't post or write there opinion on internet. Only a limited number of people with the knowledge about development and networking
would. To write any content on internet, you need to start from scratch i.e. write yourself a website, and then put content as per your wish and at the end of it
host the site publicly on your personal computer. Hence the concept on decentralization was born, the content that you put on internet wasn't backed or owned by an authorized body but by yourself. The websites would be static hence you can't interact with the platform. Sites would contain only plain media - image, text, etc. and no forms, sign in pages, cookies...,

## Web 2.0

The current web concept that we use is Web 2.0, it is centralized and is governed by various technical bodies including tech giants such as Meta(Facebook), Google, etc. So, as per date we can literally do anything with these tech, you name it - write a blog without any development knowledge, post a image, money transaction, e-commerce, virtual communication and the list goes on. But as it is centralized, most of our data is being stored on the servers of these tech giants, and by storing these data they reflect our perception. For example - you search something on google and after a while when you were scrolling through Facebook you see Ads related to it. In these way they know our most daily activities like the shops or places we are going into, things we are searching for and who might know our chats, audio or photos etc. Privacy is been bargained here for these free service. The main reason for a new web(Web3) was these- freedom and privacy. Long story short, Web2 is an Internet dominated by big tech companies that provide their service in exchange of our personal data.

## Web 3.0

Back in April 2014, Gavin Wood Co-founder of Ethereum Blockchain published an Article named “Less techy: What is Web 3.0”. He coined the term Web 3.0 or (post-Snowden Web) for the first time in his article, he clarified the need for new web and the drawbacks of the current web (i.e. Web2). He compared Web3 with Freenet and BitTorrent, the services in which you can upload and download any data without any regards to censorship and privacy.

Web3 would have four components in whole: \
**The First one** is a decentralized, encrypted information publication system. Meaning the system would allow an individual to upload or publish a part of website or a content in such a way that any other individual could access it and make changes to it without an permission required. \
**The Second component** of Web 3.0 is messaging and publication system of transient information. This is just an completely end to end encrypted system between two individuals, or one individual to all others. No one can have the access to the chats and the IP address of the devices except the individuals who are communicating.\
**The Third component** of Web 3.0 is the consensus engine. As this web is completely decentralized and is not governed by any authority, it would be in the hands of individuals to write a set of rules that needs to be followed while interacting to any platform. \
**The fourth and final component** of the Web3.0 is the technology that brings it alltogether, the browsers and the user-interface. It would be mostly or completely same as the current one (web2.0) with some minor changes. Such as we'll see a move away from the traditional client-server URL model of addresses like "https://address/path", and instead start to see new-form addresses such as "goldcoin" and "uk.gov". Periods would allow multiple levels of name resolution - "uk.gov", for example, might pass the "gov" subname into the name resolver given by "uk".

## Skeptism and myths

You might heard Web3 with Crypto, Metaverse, Blockchain and many anothe different topics. But Metaverse and Web3 are two complete different techs with no correlation between them. Whereas the Web3 is based on blockchain technology, as the main reason for development of these web was the concept of decentralization and not be governed by some tech giants and exchange our personal data in return for there services. Some say web3 might just be a buzzword to create awareness about cryptocurrencies and to get people talk about it. Stephen Diehl a Software Engineer based on London, writes in his blog “At its core web3 is a vapid marketing campaign that attempts to reframe the public’s negative associations of crypto assets into a false narrative about disruption of legacy tech company hegemony. It is a distraction in the pursuit of selling more coins and continuing the gravy train of evading securitiesregulation. We see this manifest in the circularity in which the crypto and web3 movement talks about itself. It’s not about solving real consumer problems. The only problem to be solved by web3 is how to post-hoc rationalize its own existence.

_So for now, Web 3.0 is not a promising tech, if the main reason to create web3 is it’s decentralization part then it would be complete Chaos as it wouldn’t have any body to govern by._
