        <p class="head">Web 3.0 and what's with all the fuss</p>
        <p class="info">Web3 is a buzzword, you might heard it and your mind may also associate it<br> with blockchain, cryptocurrencies and metaverse. Simply put, it is a<br> decentralized Web meaning anyone can access or provide any data without<br> worrying about any authority to suspect the chain of the data where it came<br> from. Privacy, freedom are some of its buzz ideology to work on. Firstly discussing<br> the Web3, lets take a look on the previous web concepts and ideologies.<br><br><br>
        <span class="heading">Web 1.0</span><br><br>
        Back in the days, everyone can't post or write there opinion on internet. Only a<br> limited number of people with the knowledge about development and networking<br>
        would. To write any content on internet, you need to start from scratch i.e. write<br>yourself a website, and then put content as per your wish and at the end of it<br>
        host the site publicly on your personal computer. Hence the concept on decentralization<br> was born, the content that you put on internet wasn't backed or owned by an authorized<br> body but by yourself. The websites would be static hence you can't interact with the<br> platform. Sites would contain only plain media - image, text, etc. and no forms, sign in <br>pages, cookies...,<br>
        <br><span class="heading">Web 2.0</span><br><br>
        The current web concept that we use is Web 2.0, it is centralized and is<br> governed by various technical bodies including tech giants such as<br> Meta(Facebook), Google, etc. So, as per date we can literally do anything<br> with these tech, you name it - write a blog without any development<br> knowledge, post a image, money transaction, e-commerce,<br> virtual communication and the list goes on. But as it is centralized, most of our<br> data is being stored on the servers of these tech giants, and by storing these<br> data they reflect our perception. For example - you search something on google<br> and after a while when you were scrolling through Facebook you see Ads<br> related to it. In these way they know our most daily activities like the shops<br> or places we are going into, things we are searching for and who might know<br> our chats, audio or photos etc. Privacy is been bargained here for these free<br> service. The main reason for a new web(Web3) was these- freedom and privacy.<br> Long story short, Web2 is an Internet dominated by big tech companies that <br>provide their service in exchange of our personal data.<br>
        <br><span class="heading">Web 3.0</span><br><br>
        Back in April 2014, Gavin Wood Co-founder of Ethereum Blockchain<br> published an Article named “Less techy: What is Web 3.0”. He coined<br> the term Web 3.0 or (post-Snowden Web) for the first time in his article,<br> he clarified the need for new web and the drawbacks of the current web <br>(i.e. Web2). He compared Web3 with Freenet and BitTorrent, the services<br> in which you can upload and download any data without any regards to<br> censorship and privacy.<br>
        <br>Web3 would have four components in whole:<br><br>
        The <u>First one is a decentralized, encrypted information publication system.</u><br> Meaning the system would allow an individual to upload or publish a part of<br> website or a content in such a way that any other individual could access it and<br> make changes to it without an permission required.<br><br>
        The Second component of Web 3.0 is messaging and publication system of<br> transient information. This is just an completely end to end encrypted system<br> between two individuals, or one individual to all others. No one can have the<br> access to the chats and the IP address of the devices except the individuals who<br> are communicating.<br><br>
        The Third component of Web 3.0 is the consensus engine. As this web is completely<br> decentralized and is not governed by any authority, it would be in the hands of <br> individuals to write a set of rules that needs to be followed while interacting to any<br>  platform.<br><br>
        The fourth and final component of the Web3.0 is the technology that brings it all<br> together, the browsers and the user-interface. It would be mostly or completely<br>  same as the current one (web2.0) with some minor changes. Such as we'll see a<br>  move away from the traditional client-server URL model of addresses like<br>  "https://address/path", and instead start to see new-form addresses such as<br>  "goldcoin" and "uk.gov". Periods would allow multiple levels of name resolution - <br> "uk.gov", for example, might pass the "gov" subname into the name resolver<br>  given by "uk".<br><br>
        <span class="heading">Skepticism and Myths</span><br><br>
        You might heard Web3 with Crypto, Metaverse, Blockchain and many anothe<br> different topics. But Metaverse and Web3 are two complete different techs with<br>  no correlation between them. Whereas the Web3 is based on blockchain<br>  technology, as the main reason for development of these web was the concept<br>  of decentralization and not be governed by some tech giants and exchange our<br>  personal data in return for there services. Some say web3 might just be a<br>  buzzword to create awareness about cryptocurrencies and to get people talk<br>  about it. Stephen Diehl a Software Engineer based on London, writes in his blog<br>  “At its core web3 is a vapid marketing campaign that attempts to reframe<br>  the public’s negative associations of crypto assets into a false narrative<br>  about disruption of legacy tech company hegemony. It is a distraction in the<br>  pursuit of selling more coins and continuing the gravy train of evading securities<br>  regulation. We see this manifest in the circularity in which the crypto and web3<br>  movement talks about itself. It’s not about solving real consumer problems. <br> The only problem to be solved by web3 is how to post-hoc rationalize its own<br>  existence.” Even Elon Musk tweeted in his Twitter handle -<br> <br> 
        <q>I’m not suggesting web3 is real – seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now.</q><br><br>
        So for now, Web 3.0 is not a promising tech, if the main reason to create web3 is<br> it’s decentralization part then it would be complete Chaos as it wouldn’t have any<br> body to govern by.<br><br>
