      Hello! I am Software Engineer that creates application for fun and helping
      the world become a better place. Currently, a student but I like to go
      with the profile of an engineer. Creating and building things to reduce
      human effort and time have always been the main motivation behind becoming
      an Engineer. Despite all the struggles, frustration in software
      engineering, I still find passion in that.
